Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: RETINA-VISTA is a machine learning project aimed at detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images. The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques and deep learning models to classify images into different severity levels of diabetic retinopathy.

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention to prevent vision loss.

Features
Automated Detection: Leverages deep learning for DR classification.
Scalable Solution: Handles large datasets with ease.
Customizable Architecture: Modify the model to fit specific requirements.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score.
Dataset
This project uses publicly available datasets for training and testing, such as:

Kaggle’s Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset
APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset
Ensure you have the datasets downloaded and placed in the appropriate directories as outlined in the project structure.
